# Robots Competition

A place to host code for the robots purchased by IEEE leadership. The rules can be found in `rules.md`. There is template code provided here for the competition as a guideline of where to start.

# TODO's

- Create a `TODO` file to give people a little more direction when they are first beginning the competition
- Create more links within the code documentation to note where modifications should (or should not be) made.
- Indicate level of difficulty of each modification. For example, simplifying the path is more difficult than setting up which way to turn.
- Examine whether the current selecting of turns is too obvious (it doesn't really make you think about right hand rule vs. left hand rule)

# Thank you and Credit

We want to say a big thank you to all the places online that we have gotten help from (several are credited in the help documents). Additionally, there was a lot of templating that we took from [pololu](https://github.com/pololu/libpololu-avr), which we really appreciate.
