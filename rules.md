# Calvin IEEE Maze Challenge

## Objective

Program a Pololu 3pi robot to navigate a maze succesfully.

## Competition Time

There will be a total of 3 hours of time for the programming competition and then the maze-running competition will begin.

- Programming Time:
    - Throughout the programming time, each team will be given time to test the code that they are currently writing. There are currently two robots available, so they will be distributed between the teams. For example, if there are eight teams, then each team will be given 15 minutes per hour with a robot.
