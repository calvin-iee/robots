# Calvin IEEE Maze Challenge

## Objective

Program a Pololu 3pi robot to navigate a maze successfully.

## Competition Time

There will be a total of 3 hours of time for the programming competition and then the maze-running competition will begin.

- Programming Time:
    - As mentioned above, three hours will be given for programming. During this time, teams are free to program their robots in any way that does not violate common sense and good sportsmanship.
    - Throughout the programming time, each team will be given time to test the code that they are currently writing. There are currently two robots available, so they will be distributed between the teams. For example, if there are eight teams, then each team will be given 15 minutes per hour with a robot.
    - A test maze will be given so that each team can run their robot and see if their algorithm is working correctly. However, there will be some extra difficulties in the higher level race mazes, so think ahead!
    - Once programming time is completed, each team must have their final program loaded onto their robots. They may not change this program in any way after the time is completed.

## Scoring

The following metrics will be used to assess which team wins the competition

- **Maze Completion**: There will be several checkpoints in each maze that will be worth an allotted number of points. Once a team successfully crosses a checkpoint, it will be attributed to them, regardless of run. The team which makes it to the farthest checkpoint will win, unless another team has reached the same checkpoint.
    - This means if a team only reaches the third checkpoint on the second run, they will be credited with the third checkpoint in their final score.
- **Completion Time**: If two or more teams make it to the same furthest checkpoint, then the team who reached this checkpoint more quickly will be the winner. If the teams both arrive within the same second to furthest checkpoint, then the winner will be decided by the next metric.
- **Fist Fight**: In the case that the teams are still tied, they will fight without weapons until one team yields. Unconscious team members are assumed to have yielded. No protective layering may be worn during this combat, including sweatshirts, long sleeve shirts, or knee-socks.

## Restrictions:

- **Information Passing**: The teams may not pass information to the robots in any way after the maze has been shown except for algorithm selection. This includes passing information about turns using the “a”, “b”, and “c” keys.

- **Line Following**: On any run, checkpoints or endpoints reached after the robot has left the lines will NOT count; however, the run does not need to be terminated.

- **Miscellaneous**: “We don’t know if we can do this, but let’s trick the people who made the maze and try it.” NO! Here’s the deal: If you come up with some creative way to complete the maze that seems allowable, we won’t make any announcements about it to other teams and you can keep it to yourself. But if it’s not allowable, we’ll immediately let everyone know that it’s not allowed to avoid confusion. We don’t want anyone working for hours on somethings that’s not allowable, so check with us.

## Thanks

Thanks to IEEE University of Wisconsin Chapter who created something similar to this outline, which we have adapted here.
