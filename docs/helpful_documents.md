# Helpful Documents

This file contains information that will be helpful for the competition.

## Robot Documentation

- [Documentation for the Robot API](https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J20/3)
    - The documentation is divided into several different areas to find what you are looking for
    - Follow the links and you should be able to find documentation for any of the functions you see or questions that you have
    - Please restrict yourself to only looking in chapter 3 of this website. Other chapters contain example code that may spoil the fun :)
- Important notes:
    - The robot has only 2048 Bytes of RAM. This means you must be very careful about memory usage

## Design Documents

- [Outline of solving simple mazes](https://www.pololu.com/file/download/line-maze-algorithm.pdf?file_id=0J195)
    - It provides some pseudocode that tells how to handle many different cases
    - It does not provide any source code (intended), but will make the user write the code
- [Example of a very good robot!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJV-KDqHgDQ&ab_channel=BenPololu)
    - It contains path simplification, acceleration and fun sounds! Try to get as many of those as you can.

## Maze Design Documents
